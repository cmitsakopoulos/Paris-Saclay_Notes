## Preliminary statements
- Information has various levels, connected with each other; take as an example the sequence and thereby 3D-structure of a protein.
- Appropriate information into asking questions about phenomena; from information to acquiring knowledge and from knowledge to acquiring wisdom.
    - All this can be done within the guidance of the scientific method.
~
- The scientific method requires ***inductive (inference) and deductive (combination of facts) reasoning***.
- Logic is **objective**, or what he means, rational deduction.
- The scientific method ensures that observations are collected and processed for the **emergence of patterns**, (systematic re-occurences), to then designate these patterns as **observable** and **reoccuring** *phenomena*.
- From the identification of possible patterns, we generate a hypothesis on what a pattern could be, to then investigate it and confirm or deny our hypothesis on a pattern.
    - Hypotheses aren't necesserally based on observed patterns, could be inference from similar experiments.
- A hypothesis should be testable, parsimonious, connect x dependents with x independents with a stated relationship, should have a null hypothesis (hypothesis itself is the alternative), should make clear if there is correlation or also causation. 
    - Choice of the simplest possible to explanation to a phenomenon; Occam's razor.

Say we have a drug (independent) that will kill breast cancer cells, we don't want the number of cancer cells to be our dependent specifically; we want to observe the proportion of cancer cell **types** which are dying. In other words, if we are examining different cell types, we can observe if the drug **prevents** the emergence of new cell types, or just kills a specific **cell type**.
