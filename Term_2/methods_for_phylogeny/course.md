# Phylogeny and diversity of microbial metabolism

## General terms
Remember to mention in an exam about the differences between a light microscope and an electron microscope, which organisms they can magnify: 

- Maximum magnification/minimum size of detection for **light microscopes** is 0.2 micrometre.
- Maximum magnification/minimum size of detection for **electron microscopes** is 100000x stronger than light...

## Viruses
Viruses, which are non-cellular organisms (considered not alive; no metabolism, waste, respiration etc...) are the most important component of the microbial world.
- Remember that its DNA or RNA molecule (depending on the class), is contained within a **protein capsule**; a ==**capsid**==.

Professor termed viruses as **==intracellular== parasites**, both for eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Bacteriophages are the **most important** virus as presented by the professor and are therefore ***25x*** more **prevalent** in the microbial world, than the rest.

## Prokaryotes and additional information
Dont forget to go over cellular structures for prokaryotes (*dont forget the importance of cellular walls*; **peptidoglycan**, **Gram-positive or Gram-negative** are affected differently) or eukaryotes in an exam:

**Nucleoid** in prokaryotes contain the DNA; dont forget to mention plasmids (antiobiotic-**resistance**/**linear** plasmids=bold-important).

Cellular wall protects, with its **NAG-NAM-tetrapeptide** structured peptidoglycan, against **osmotic pressure**.

- **Mircoplasm->Microbiome**

If asked about the terminology of **Pro**-karyote, dont be retarded. What separates eukaryotes and prokaryotes? **Organelles**, cell wall, flagella, etc.

Prokaryotes are split into: 
- **Bacteria** obviously.
- **Archaea** obviously.

**What differentiates them?** ==Metabolism== and ==Architecture==:

- ==Archaea **don't have** peptidoglycan== and their cellular membrane is composed of ==**glycerol** joined to **phytanols** through an **ether link**==. 

- Whereas bacteria have **ester-linked** **glycerol and ==fatty acids==** in their cellular membrane.

Because of these cellular structures, bacteria can **ONLY** survive up to 80C. 

Whereas for **Archaea** often assume the survivability of **extremophiles**; able to survive in ***highly alkaline, or acidic conditions, or even 121C***.

Remember that eukaryotes can mostly survive up to 62C, to compare.
