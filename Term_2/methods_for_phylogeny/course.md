# Phylogeny and diversity of microbial metabolism

Remember to mention in an exam about the differences between a light microscope and an electron microscope, which organisms they can magnify: 

- Maximum magnification/minimum size of detection for **light microscopes** is 0.2 micrometre.
- Maximum magnification/minimum size of detection for **electron microscopes** is 100000x stronger than light...

Viruses, which are non-cellular organisms (considered not alive; no metabolism, waste, respiration etc...) are the most important component of the microbial world.
- Remember that its DNA or RNA molecule (depending on the class), is contained within a **protein capsule**; a ==**capsid**==.

Professor termed viruses as **==intracellular== parasites**, both for eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Bacteriophages are the **most important** virus as presented by the professor and are therefore ***25x*** more **prevalent** in the microbial world, than the rest.
