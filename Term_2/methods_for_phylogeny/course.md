# Phylogeny and diversity of microbial metabolism

## General terms
Remember to mention in an exam about the differences between a light microscope and an electron microscope, which organisms they can magnify: 

- Maximum magnification/minimum size of detection for **light microscopes** is 0.2 micrometre.
- Maximum magnification/minimum size of detection for **electron microscopes** is 100000x stronger than light...

## Viruses
Viruses, which are non-cellular organisms (considered not alive; no metabolism, waste, respiration etc...) are the most important component of the microbial world.
- Remember that its DNA or RNA molecule (depending on the class), is contained within a **protein capsule**; a ==**capsid**==.

Professor termed viruses as **==intracellular== parasites**, both for eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Bacteriophages are the **most important** virus as presented by the professor and are therefore ***25x*** more **prevalent** in the microbial world, than the rest.

## Prokaryotes and additional information
Dont forget to go over cellular structures for prokaryotes (*dont forget the importance of cellular walls*; **peptidoglycan**, **Gram-positive or Gram-negative** are affected differently) or eukaryotes in an exam:

**Nucleoid** in prokaryotes contain the DNA; dont forget to mention plasmids (antiobiotic-**resistance**/**linear** plasmids=bold-important).

Cellular wall protects, with its **NAG-NAM-tetrapeptide** structured peptidoglycan, against **osmotic pressure**.

- **Mircoplasm->Microbiome**

If asked about the terminology of **Pro**-karyote, dont be retarded. What separates eukaryotes and prokaryotes? **Organelles**, cell wall, flagella, etc.

Prokaryotes are split into: 
- **Bacteria** obviously.
- **Archaea** obviously.

**What differentiates them?** ==Metabolism== and ==Architecture==:

- ==Archaea **don't have** peptidoglycan== and their cellular membrane is composed of ==**glycerol** joined to **phytanols** through an **ether link**==. 

- Whereas bacteria have **ester-linked** **glycerol and ==fatty acids==** in their cellular membrane.

Because of these cellular structures, bacteria can **ONLY** survive up to 80C. 

Whereas for **Archaea** often assume the survivability of **extremophiles**; able to survive in ***highly alkaline, or acidic conditions, or even 121C***.

Remember that eukaryotes can mostly survive up to 62C, to compare.

==Robert Whittacker== was the one who re-arranged the kingdoms for fungi, separating them from **protists** (unicellular) and creating a new kingdom for **filamentous** **multicellular** organisms such as Fungi.

- What was termed as **Monera** in the old classification, he designated them **Prokaryotes**.

## Microbiota

A microbiome has by extension, a **colective genome** *derived from its multiple components*:

To analyse a microbiota, one should "ask" some questions:

- What is there? What are the components? What are their differences and proportions?
- What are these components doing themselves or in conjunction with each other, what is their purpose? How do they transform their environment?

Think of the competition induced between the gut microbiome and newly introduced bacteria, otherwise the contribution of the microbiota to our nutriotional acquisition; metabolic processes which we cannot undertake ourselves and require the services of microbes in our gut, which can either digest our food to give us nutrients or even process toxic compounds.

## Antibiotic agents
- **Penicillin** and **Bacitracin** are ==cell wall== disolvers; *dissolving peptidoglycan*. 
- **Polymixin B**, **Cyclohexemide** aim to destroy the ==cell memrbnane==.
- **Chloranmphenicol** and **Streptomycin** target ==protein synthesis== (through bacterial uptake)
- **Rifampin**, ==inhibits RNA== within the nucleiod. 

## Bacterial structure

Remember the multiple forms in which bacteria can exist; in a **Rod** structure, a **Coccus** (ex. little grain of sand)--a **Diplococcus** is obvious and in **Spirill** formation (squiggly line).

## Fungal structure

You can have **unicellular** fungi, such as Saccharomyces.

You can also have, more common, **filamentous** fungi, formed of a large conga line of fungal cells/==conga line of **hyphae**==, therefore you observe *cell walls separating each cell within this conga line*.

- Remember the fungal cell wall is composed of **chitin**.

==Multinuclear filament fungi can be==:
- Ascomycetes
- Basidiomycetes
- Zygomycetes

Endosporilation
: Fungal ==**cysts**== can **interject** between the cells of the conga line, which contain **endospores** and are thereby essential in the *further proliferation/colonisation efforts of fungi*, through repeated **secretion** of these endospores from its **permanent** cyst.

Exosporilation
: Otherwise, you might observe the formation of **sporocysts** in fungi, which do not retain their spores within a cyst, but persist in secreting **exospores**.

- The **Mycete/Mycis** suffix, reffers to fungi and can serve as a descriptor for bacterial names; ==picturing the bacteria as filamentous, although unicellular==.

Actinomycetes therefore are the **conjugation of the mycete suffix** and the prefix **actino**; a **Gram-positive** bacterial species which looks like a starfish.
