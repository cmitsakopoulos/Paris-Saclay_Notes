# 1. Auxotroph and Autotroph Concepts  

### 1.a. Auxotroph  
An **auxotroph** requires an additional organic compound for its growth:  
- **Amino acids**: 1 mg/L  
- **Vitamins**: 4 μg/L  
- **Nucleotides**: 1 mg/L  

We are auxotrophic because of:  
- 10 essential amino acids (AA)  
- Vitamin C  
- Unsaturated lipids  

The concept is the opposite of **Prototroph** (need only carbon, minerals, and energy sources).

### Autotroph  
**Autotroph** refers to the production of your own food:  
- **Source**: CO₂ or HCO₃⁻ (inorganic) and organic sources (e.g., sucrose, bicarbonate).  
- Includes:  
  - **Chemo synthesizer**  
  - **Photosynthesis**

### 1.b. False  

---

### 1.c. True  
- **CIS-enriched**  
- **Solid - Isolate**

# 2. Strain A and Basic Medium Requirements  

**Strain A** needs only **basic medium**.  

### Key Components:  

1. **K₂PO₄ (Potassium Phosphate)**  
   - Buffer agent.  
   - Provides **K⁺** and **P** sources to produce nucleotides and ATP.  

2. **NO₃⁻ (Nitrate)**  
   - Involved in matrix production.  
   - Nitrate breaks down → **Ammonia**: AA precursor (used in AA synthesis and protein synthesis).  
   - **Macroelements**: C, H, O, N, S, P.  

3. **MgSO₄ (0.2 g)**  
   - Used in its oxide form (as **SO₄²⁻**).  
   - **Mg²⁺** is an essential element:  
     - Enzyme catalysis  
     - Cofactor  
     - Ribosome and DNA stabilizer  

4. **CaCl₂**  
   - Important in metabolism:  
     - Enzymatic cofactor  
     - Enzymatic activator  
     - Stabilizes cell membranes
