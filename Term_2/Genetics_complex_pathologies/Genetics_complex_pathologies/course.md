# Genetic Diseases and calculating risk

## Distignuishing between Monogenic and Multifactorial Genetic Diseases

### Penetrance and Phenocopy

1. **Penetrance**:

- Penetrance is classified as the **proportion of individuals** (within a group) who are carrying a **specific variant** and also **present an associated phenotype** (trait) with that variant.

- It can only be calculated by **comparing genomic data between family members**, NOT large populations.

Or in other words, (in our case), how many people present an allelic variant and trait **within a family**. 

Penentrance is measured with the following formula:

==Penetrance==
: $ [Y] / X $

Where **X**:

Refers to the number of people with the "malicious" genotype (**all cariers within a family**-*affected or not*)

Where **Y**:

Refers to the number of people who have been **affected/have the traits** of the **"malicious"** phenotype

A **HIGH** level of penetrance is set on a threshold between ==**0.8 < 1**==.

2. **Phenocopy**:

- Could be seen as the opposite of penetrance;

Phenocopy
: $[X] / Y$

Where **X**:

Refers to the number of people who have been **affected/have the traits** of the **"malicious"** phenotype

Where **Y**:

Refers to the number of people who **are healthy** and have a **completely different genotype** to those with disease.

### Mendelian Entity

A **rare variant**, which is ==associated with **high** disease risk==.

When the **penetrance** of a specific variant **exceeds 0.8**, these are typically seen in **Monogenic** diseases.

### Susceptibility Genes

Are often **frequent variants**, which are thereby associated with **low disease-risk**. 

- If these variants were actually high-disease risk and frequent, we would all be dead.

### Monogenic Diseases: Hereditary

- Characterised by a **single genetic problem**; a **Mendelian** entity. As such, these diseases are ==**NOT characterised** by **environmental factors**==, their impact is **low**.

- Characterised by ***rare disease frequency*** within the larger population, but ***inversely*** within families, due to **high** penetrance, are **NOT** rare.

- While there is a **single driving genetic problem**, consider that *mutations will still occur in other genes*; they're just **not causal**.

- Keeping all of the above in mind, we can say that **familial agregation** is **very high**, as the **penetrance within the family** is high.

### Complex Diseases: Multifactorial

- Characterised by a **range of genetic factors**; both **genetic and environmental**. Primarily, **environmental factors play a medium to highly important role** in the development of the disease.

Consider the effect of environmental factors in multifactoral diseases as adding petrol to a fire.

Multifactoral diseases are **on a spectrum**, where the **effect environmental factors** have on the individual, greatly depend on the allelic genotype of the individual.

- Characterised by **low** penetrance within families and by extension, ==**multiple confounding genes**==, **confounding factors**, which therfore mean **low familial aggragation**. (Consider that **~5-10% of families have medium-high penetrance** with multifactorial disease)
