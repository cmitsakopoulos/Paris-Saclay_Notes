## Understanding BLOSUM62; why its used in BLAST

A BLOSUM62 statistic is based on a **subsitution matrix** generated on ==**log-odds**== of one ***amino acid to be substituted for another***, in a set of protein multiple sequence alignments.

- Therefore imagine a distance matrix arranged against the amino acids in a pairwise comparison of protein sequences.
