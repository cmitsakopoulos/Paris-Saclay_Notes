## Sequence Alignment
### CLUSTALW

An algorithm used for ***Global Alignments***, but which is considered less effective than others.

The tool will calculate the distance matrix between sequences, which distance expresses the **relative-time distance** of **speciation** which led to these sequences ***differing through substitutions*** etc.

Using ***Neighbour-Joining*** it will create a ==**guide tree**==, to later obtain the multiple alignment; this tree does not represent phylogenetic relationship directly.

Neighbour-Joining:
: Can be performed by the ***UPGMA method (==Unweighted== Pair Groups with Arithmetic Mean)*** to calculate distance, if we are to **assume that branches were created at the same time**; ![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 09.34.30.png>) Where: n is the "number of sequences" (to account for groups) 
Else, ***WPGMA method (==Weighted== Pair Groups with Arithmetic Mean)***: ![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 09.37.04.png>)

First we will identify the smallest value within the distance matrix denoted above; this distance matrix is generated by CLUSTALW through sequence alignment.
