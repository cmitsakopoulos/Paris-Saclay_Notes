## Sequence Alignment
### CLUSTALW

An algorithm used for ***Global Alignments***, but which is considered less effective than others.

The tool will calculate the distance matrix between sequences, which distance expresses the **relative-time distance** of **speciation** which led to these sequences ***differing through substitutions*** etc.

Using ***Neighbour-Joining*** it will create a ==**guide tree**==, to later obtain the multiple alignment; this tree does not represent phylogenetic relationship directly.

Neighbour-Joining:
: Can be performed by the ***UPGMA method (==Unweighted== Pair Groups with Arithmetic Mean)*** to calculate distance, if we are to **assume that branches were created at the same time**; ![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 09.34.30.png>) Where: n is the "number of sequences" (to account for groups) 
Else, ***WPGMA method (==Weighted== Pair Groups with Arithmetic Mean)***: ![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 09.37.04.png>)

### Calculating UPGMA: Worked Example.

To more easily read the table and work on the calculations, the sequences can be renamed to A, B, C, D and E.

| Distance Matrix | A | B | C | D | E |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| A | \- | 8 | 15 | 38 | 30 |
| B |  | \- | **7** | 45 | 40 |
| C |  |  | \- | 50 | 47 |
| D |  |  |  | \- | 20 |
| E |  |  |  |  | \- |

Now, we will first identify the smallest value within the distance matrix denoted above; this distance matrix is generated by CLUSTALW through sequence alignment in phylogenetic inference.

As the smallest distance represents the **nearest phylogenetic distance between two sequences**, they should be **grouped together**.

Following the grouping/**rooting** of these two sequences, let's look at the rest; this involves recreating a table and recalculating distances with:

| Distance Matrix | A | B, C | D | E |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A | \- | **11.5** | 38 | 30 |
| B |  | \- | 47.5 | 43.5 |
| D |  |  | \- | 20 |
| E |  |  |  | \- |

From these calculations we can see that A and BuC share a common ancestor, they should therefore be anchored together.
