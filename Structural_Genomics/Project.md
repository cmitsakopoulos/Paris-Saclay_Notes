# Analysing Genomic region 6

### Softberry page

Genomic region is from plants: http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=case_study_plants&no_menu=on

The link contains multiple tools that can supplement analysis by:

## Reccomended analysis steps

1. Structural annotation:
    - **FEGENESH**:
        - Get **coordinates** at which introns and exons are arranged in the genomic region
        - **mRNA** sequences from our genomic region (transcribed info)
        - **protein** sequence

2. Validate Data: 
    - Compare our data with mRNA, RNAseq, EST data on **SRA** or **abEST**.
    - Then compare with homologous proteins; BLAST?
    - Whole genome comparison between samples of Tritium | monococcum durum
