# Structural and functional annotation of genomes

In fucntional genomics two questions have to be answered:

1. Where are the genes within the genome and how are they distributed?
=> Structual Annotation
2. What fucntion do these genes have, does this relate to their position?
=> Functional Annotation

## Identifying genetic signals within sequences

1. Look for **start and stop** codons.
2. In **non-plant** sequences, the **TATA box**, the **motif**, the **GC box**.
3. Find **Transcription Start Site** (TSS).
4. Find the **introns** and the **exons**.
