Genotyping bead cheap arrays are used for pangenomic association studies. Therefore, 1 to 2 million of pangenomic variants are tested in complex diseases such as cancers or autoimmune diseases.
### 1 which type of human genome variants are mostly analyzed with these arrays? Give specific characteristics for these variants.

GWAS focuses on identifying common variants such as SNPs, to create a control profile which will be used in downstream analyses of personalised medicine. Specifically, these variants have a minor allele frequency of above 1%, the outstanding majority of which (99%) are non-coding and have little pathophysiological effect. However, in case of exceptions, these variants can be discovered in QTL(quantitative expressive trait locus), or otherwise in regions where gene expression is active.

In average, about 4 million of such variants are characterized by genome.
### 2 which data will allow to decrease the number of investigated variants per array, independently of their position and their potential deleterious effect? How this data is obtained ?

We would refer to linkage disequilibrium statistical measures on the relationship between SNPs, which are located on adjacent loci. This statistical measure can decrease depending on the genetic distance of loci (and by extension SNPs), as well as evolutionary developments over time.

More specifically, LD is a function of observed and theoretical frequencies for SNPs, which when normalised with the frequency of each allele, will provide us an r squared value; at threshold 0.8, we determine that the SNPs are highly correlated and therefore are theoretically "present together" (if one exists, we know the other one will most probably exist too).

_______________________
Analyses of whole genome and whole exome sequences are current strategies to complete identification of genomic variants associated with complex diseases.
### 3 Give the advantage(s) of such sequencing strategies compared to the use of pangenomic genotyping arrays (do not cite general advantages of sequencing strategies).
