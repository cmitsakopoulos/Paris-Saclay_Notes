### Question 1

Sequence and annotate both tissue samples, then **compare the variants** between these samples **after removing the common variants** from the equation.

### Question 2

The amount of times certain parts of the genome have been sequenced, in our case, while the genome was sequenced 10k times, the **value is an average**, therefore, since the number is lower we have regions of the DNA that were sequenced less or some possibly even more.

### Question 3

VAF: How many reads have a variant at the same position (%).

Mitochondrial DNA is stored in multiple copies within a cell, therefore you want to be less stringent when trying to identify VAF in mDNA; VAF threshold is much higher, due to obviously there being a lot more mDNA to compare between.

In Figure 1, no difference is observed between the different thresholds for VAF, therefore a largely homogeneous distribution of variance throughout the genome. 

Peaks of variance are observed in proximity the D-loop, which regulates replication of the DNA and is therefore important for cancer development. 

Another peak is seen at gene NO4.
