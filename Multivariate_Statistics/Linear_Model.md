# An introduction to stats

## Linear Regression: A linear model.

**Simple Linear Regression**, or a **Multiple Linear Regression**:

### Example:

#### Simple Linear Regression

Does *height* influence the **weight** of a person?

* One independent variable and one dependent.

#### Multiple Linear Regression

Do *height* and *gender* influence the **weight** of a person?

* **two independent** variables and one dependent.

Key:
**Dependent** variable
*Independent* variables

## Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

The aim of this statistical prediction model is to identify a relationship between **two** sets of data; 

This would graphically be represented with a linear equation:

### $y = b * x + a$

*Where*:

$y$ is the **dependent/expected** variable
$b$ the **slope**
$x$ the **independent** 
$α$ the **y-intercept**

Alpha and Beta are termed **regression coefficients**, the unknown values which **influence** the predictor values.

When we have what appears to be a linear relationship, in order to properly classify it, we must attempt to locate the best possible fit/line between all points. The **distance** between the predicted line and the data points which are correlated, is called the **residual**, the **ERROR**, represented by **epsilon**; $ϵ$.

### SLR formula: $Y=f(X,β)+ϵ$
Where:

Y is the response, or **dependent** variable;
$f$ is some mathematical function;
X is a matrix of predictor (**independent**) variables;
$β$ are the model parameters;
$ϵ$ is the random error term (residual).

You would use this statistical model to characterise a **linear relationship** between given sets of values.
