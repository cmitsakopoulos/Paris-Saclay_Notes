Tuples are immutable, they are the shit I was using to return multiple variables from functions. Ex: genstart, genend, etc. Just use lists or dictionaries.  

Methodologies for modelling can vary depending on the need; obviously, if you are creating **planes** etc, you need accurate and robust systems.  
**Code reusability** is paramount.  

**Non-structured programming** (*imperative programming*): Functions that do stuff, without a given structure or consecutive functions.  
**1st order programming**: ex. interactions between different functions, with limited dependencies, clean code which is less prone to error.  
**Higher order programming**: when you consider functions as a variable, or in other words, when you concatenate functions, integrate them with each other.  
**Declarative programming**: when you work towards a certain goal, SQL, where the process is not defined, as in imperative programming, you express the logic but not the control flow; think of **PROLOG**, where you program a certain logical framework, to handle data or assign data.
